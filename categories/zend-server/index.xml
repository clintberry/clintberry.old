      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally did it. I bought a mac. And after navigating around OS X for ten minutes using the multi-touch pad, I can honestly tell you I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ll ever go back. As I use it more I am curious to see if developing on my new, sleek, aluminum toy will continue to bring the feelings of ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was install Zend Server CE to develop and test locally on my machine. Here are my notes on the Zend Server CE installation for the OS X, which didn&amp;#8217;t seem as user friendly as it&amp;#8217;s Windows Installer counterpart. But I am such a noob with Macs it is probably just me. This is for all you windows developers making the switch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
